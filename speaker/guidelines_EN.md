# Speaker Information – EC ICS/OT Cyber Forum
Thank you for your interest in presenting at an Eastern Canada ICS/OT Cyber Community forum.
## Eastern Canada ICS/OT Cyber Community Group
### Purpose
A trusted, practitioner-focused forum where Canadian ICS/OT professionals share real-world experiences, discuss emerging threats, and exchange practical approaches to improving operational resilience.
### Members
The group is newly formed but is expected to be composed of members from across Eastern Canada, with some joining from Western Canada and beyond. Members are expected to come from various backgrounds, including:
- IT, OT, and ICS professionals - technical and management lens
- Owner/operators, technology/service providers, academics, and government
- Critical (CNI) and non-critical (e.g., manufacturing) industrial organizations

Most members are expected to have a good understanding of OT principles (please skip the low-maturity basics, such as IT vs OT and CIA vs AIC).

Content is expected to assume a working knowledge of industrial environments and OT security concepts. This forum is intended for practitioners and decision-makers operating at intermediate to advanced maturity levels.
### Events
Nominally, virtual forums (MSTeams) and, as the group matures, expanding to hybrid and in-person events. 

We aim to host approximately one-quarter of our events in French (Canadian), subject to speaker availability.

## Typical Online Forum Agenda (weekday afternoon)

-	[1:45 pm] [Pre-call technical checks]
-	2:00 pm Start call – intro from host
-	2:05 pm Speaker presentation using slides
-	2:35 pm Open discussion forum on presentation topic
-	3:00 pm Call ends

## Typical Talk Content
The talk should have a focus on topics of interest to the Eastern Canada ICS/OT Cyber Community
-	In general, talks should be technical and/or strategic in nature.
-	Presentations from practitioners and/or decision-makers are welcome.
-	Talks should have an industrial control system focus – OT security (not corporate IT/enterprise)
-	Talks referencing standards (e.g., CCSPA, NERC-CIP, IEC-62443) are welcome when grounded in implementation experience, architectural decisions, or lessons learned—not high-level overviews.
-	Talks that primarily promote a specific product, service, or commercial offering will not be accepted.
-	Sales and marketing presenters are discouraged.
-	To maintain a non-commercial focus, please limit any ‘about company’ slides to 1 slide and spend no more than 30 seconds on this topic. Content focus should not be on your company or what it does or sells, but on the issues and problems it addresses.
-	If in doubt, vendor content should be framed as: “Independent of any commercial outcome, here is how we approach the problem and solution,” with the goal of informing and inspiring rather than pitching.
