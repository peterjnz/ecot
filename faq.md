# Frequently Asked Questions

## Motivations

Q: Has this been established as a sales/marketing/commercial funnel?

A: Emphatically no. This is a by-the-community for-the-community, by-OT for-OT initiative.
Sales/marketing/commercial presenters are explicitly prohibited per the speaker guidelines (available in [EN](../main/speaker/guidelines_EN.md) and [FR-CA](../main/speaker/guidelines_FR_CA.md))
Technology and service providers are welcome to attend and learn. Presenters from these types of organizations will be scrutinized to ensure presentations align with the group's values and code of conduct

## Overlaps

Q: Is this group set up to compete with other groups operating in this space?

A: Not at all. The committee believes this group fits into a niche. As the group evolves, synergies are expected to emerge with national and provincial groups (government, academic, industry, etc.)

## Expectations

Q: What should people expect when they sign up for the group?

A: In 2026, they should expect to receive invites to online forums discussing intermediate ICS/OT topics covering any and all areas of interest:
 - Strategic, governance, risk, compliance topics
 - Tactical, technical, implementation topics
 - Operate/maintain and project topics

In the online forums, members should expect:
 - Opening remarks from the host/facilitator
 - A ~25-30 min presentation from a presenter (monologue) representing ~20% of the value of attendance
 - ~25-30 min of discussion on the topic presented (dialogue) representing ~80% of the value of attendance

In the future (directed by the membership, represented by the committee):
 - Potential for hybrid (in-person + online) and/or in-person-only forums
 - Potential for more provincial focus for some forum events
