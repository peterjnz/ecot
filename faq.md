# Frequently Asked Questions

## Motivations

Q: Has this been established as a sales/marketing/commercial funnel?

A: Emphatically no. This is a by-the-community for-the-community, by-OT for-OT initiative.

- This is made clear in the code of conduct ([EN](../main/README.md#code-of-conduct) and [FR-CA](../main/README.md#code-de-conduite))
- Sales/marketing/commercial presenters are explicitly prohibited per the speaker guidelines (available in [EN](../main/speaker/guidelines_EN.md) and [FR-CA](../main/speaker/guidelines_FR_CA.md))
- Technology and service providers are welcome to attend and learn. 
- Presenters from these types of organizations will be scrutinized to ensure presentations align with the group's values and code of conduct.

## Overlaps

Q: Is this group set up to compete with other groups operating in this space?

A: Not at all. The committee believes this group fits into a niche. As the group evolves, synergies are expected to emerge with national and provincial groups (government, academic, industry, etc.)

## Expectations

Q: What should people expect when they sign up for the group?

A: In 2026, they should expect to receive invites to online forums discussing intermediate ICS/OT topics covering any and all areas of interest:
 - Strategic, governance, risk, compliance topics
 - Tactical, technical, implementation topics
 - Operate/maintain and project topics

In the online forums, members should expect:
 - Opening remarks from the host/facilitator
 - A ~25-30 min presentation from a presenter (monologue) representing ~20% of the value of attendance
 - ~25-30 min of discussion on the topic presented (dialogue) representing ~80% of the value of attendance

In the future (directed by the membership, represented by the committee):
 - Potential for hybrid (in-person + online) and/or in-person-only forums
 - Potential for more provincial focus for some forum events
